        <h1> Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thought </h1>
        <h2> ⎯⎯⎯⎯ Ulises Carrión ⎯⎯⎯⎯ </h2>
        <p> Ulises Carrión: Mail Art and the Big Monster was a very interesting read. I always knew what mail art is but never conceptually picked it apart like Carrión did. After reading this text, I have come to the understanding and conclusion that although a big part of mail art is the art that the artist produces, an even bigger part is the system it has to oblige to. Although the mailing system is not apart of the art that the artist produces, because of the artist deciding and choosing their piece to become mail, it must follow strict and precise guidelines and have its fate be out of the artist’s control. </p>

        <h1> Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully </h1>
        <h2> ⎯⎯⎯⎯ Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U ⎯⎯⎯⎯ </h2>
        <p> In Laurel Schwulst's essay, I really loved how she emphasized how connected our identities are to the web, particularly websites. I have always been the type to say "I don't need a website" like Schwulst mentions. I have always kept my work in a folder in Google Drive and called it a day. However, after reading her essay, I have come to realized how bland that is and how much more of my identity I can create with a website. A lot of the artists I love today have beautiful websites that further illuminates their work, creativity, and identity. I have always been a bit timid as an artist and I feel Schwulst has taught me to be not only an artist but an author who writes and creates my own world that defines me. Schwulst's use of metaphors was really enjoyable to read and got the point across about the diverse uses of websites. Edouard U's essay helped me understand more about perception and open-mindedness, that its better to have many different viewpoints, opinions, thoughts, concepts, and ideas available to you then to be closed minded and isolated to single ones. I found his co-reading and co-listening methods very impressive as I am someone who is very set to finishing one thing at a time. However, after U's essay, I might try his methods out! An artist apart of a world that is web and digitally dependent, It is not only crucial to have this open-mindedness to become more knowledgable about the web, but to also help contribute to knowledge networks with my own newly curated thoughts and ideas.</p>

        <h1>Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer⎯⎯⎯⎯ </h2>
        <p>I'm not really sure how I feel about this week's text. I felt it was a bit dense to read however I did find it enjoyable to learn about print v. digital and in general how much publishing has changed over time. I really found it thought provoking how Alessandro Ludovico and Florian Cramer claims this change over time to be a "mutation", which is essentially stating that something that occurs naturally and is deemed as normal starts to undergo change "abnormally". It causes me to think just how normal technology and dependency on technology is now and how changes from print to digital in the past that was once viewed as revolutionary and abnormal is now absolutely normal. It is such an intriguing and new POV to observe!</p>

        <h1>STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Olia Lialina⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>“STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities” by Olia Lialina was an interesting and informational article to read. Before reading this article, I never knew of the term "Geocities". After reading the article, I learnt about the difference between the web then and now. Since I am more of a visual learner, I wanted to see just how different it was. To my great surprise, very different. Googling Geocities, I didn't except to see what I saw. Everything is so personalizable and unique!!! It feels like personalities displayed on a screen compared to the "curated for a certain audience" feel we have today. Everythin must be neat and pleasing to the eye. I wish we can go back to the geocities era and just have fun with it all! </p>

        <h1>Dispersion</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Seth Price⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>Dispersion by Seth Price was a peculiar text, in my opinion. I found it very hard to read and comprehend and found myself lost majority of the time trying to keep up with the contents of the article. I think this was mainly due to his style of writing and the usage of terms that are "too fancy" for me. <br>
            
            However, I was able to take away Price's strong take on distribution vs production, that artists cared more about how their art was distributed than how it was produced. He emphasized the cruciality of ensuring work, art, pieces had meaning and that that should be the main focus. I totally agree. I found his mention of a popular album or website being more more engaging and successful than physical pieces of art really thought provoking as it made a lot of sense how our views and taste evolves alongside how technology and the digital world evolves. <br>
            
            Art used to, and sometimes still continues to be, viewed as admirable and impressive by the long laborious hours and evident display of details a work possesses. I wonder how specifically this search of craftsmanship has changed as the digital age evolved. Are people just so amazed by technology that physical art and digital art are viewed synonymously? Or is technology so impressive and new that anything produced on it is immediately deemed impressive no matter how small of a task? <br>

        <h1>Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>The Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook was a very interesting piece that furthered my understanding of alt-text and its usability. I first encountered alt-text in my previous design class and honestly, I understood its purpose but was unaware of its true capabilities. This workbook was able to help me understand that. Artists have a great role when writing their alt-texts because this will be how their work will be perceived. Artists make their work to be interpretable, meaning it is open to many different views and thoughts, but in the case of an alt-text, the work must be pre-interpreted for the viewer who is using this accessibility tool. Even if artists try their best to be just descriptive, there is certainly some "bias" when it comes to how the artist wants their work interpreted. This makes me wonder how alt-texts can actually go against a work of art in it being completely up to interpretation to viewers.
            All in all, love the text. Easy to read, easy to understand, and love that there are practice exercises!

        <h1>Selections from New Modernism(s)</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Ben Duvall⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>Reading New Modernism(s) by Ben Duvall, I learned a lot about the evolution of graphic design. It's not just about aesthetics but also about how meaning is conveyed. It really made me look at graphic design in a different light.With the rise of the internet, there's this vast shift in how signs and symbols are perceived, making design more intricate and interconnected.  It's like everything's become this interconnected web of meaning.  I really find it intriguing how how past design movements can have this significant impact that shapes our digital era.
            I was genuinely surprised by the parallels drawn between early Disney animations and the Bauhaus movement!!

        <h1>"A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h1>
        <h2> ⎯⎯⎯⎯Ramsey Nasser⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>Ramsey Nasser's "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonizing the Digital helped me understand the importance of inclusivity and cultural awareness in software development. Before reading this article, I was unaware of the fact that almost all programming languages were in the English language, making people who are non English speaking or English proficient excluded from using these programs to their fullest potential. This creates a barrier between these users and disallows them to engage and use technology to its fullest. It was really interesting to learn about !#, seeing as to how it utilizes arabic keywords and steps away from using the dominant programming language English.

        <h1>Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Dot Tuer⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>I found Dot Tuer's article "Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games" particularly fascinating, as it provided a deep insight into Vera Frenkel's exploration of absence and memory through her innovative use of new media.

            The way Frenkel used a simple string in her teleconferencing performance to bridge physical distance and create a shared experience resonated with me on a personal level. When I started reading about Frenkel's work, it reminded me of a Chinese hand string game my mother taught me when I was a little kid. This traditional game, often played with a simple piece of a looped string, was a way for us to connect. The string in our hands became a medium for storytelling, much like Frenkel's "String Games", where the string acted as a metaphor for connection and communication.
            
            This parallel evokes a powerful reflection on how simple, everyday objects and actions can hold profound cultural and emotional significance much like Frenkel's art connects narratives and memories across different media.

        <h1>Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think</h1>
        <h2>⎯⎯⎯⎯Hito Steyerl⎯⎯⎯⎯</h2>
        <p>Reading 'Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think?' by Hito Steyerl really got me thinking about my dream to become a video game designer and illustrator. It's super interesting how the article talks about games being similar to real-life stuff like war and how they affect what we think and do. It's got me pumped to create games that are fun but also make people think about important things happening around us. And the part about the Turing Test? That's pretty cool, and it's making me want to put more brain-teasing stuff in the games I hope to make one day.
