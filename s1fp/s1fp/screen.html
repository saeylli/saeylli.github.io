<br> hi, i'm saeylli! sally's virtual assistant.
<br>
<br> sally has always had an issue finding a way to display her work...
<br> normal websites are BORING. 
<br> 
<br> so, i've decided to turn her work into an interactive game! 
<br> why not have some fun :)
<br>
<br> <u>WELCOME TO SALLY'S VIRTUAL & INTERACTIVE  ZINE!!! </u>
<br>
<br> however, this isn't any normal zine. 
<br> viewing sally's latest work won't be easy...
<br>
<br> you see... i've hidden her work all around her (virtual) room. 
<br>
<br> lets play a game of hide and go seek!
<br> it is YOUR job to find them all!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>


<table id="styledtable">
    <tr>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</section>


<br> 
<br> there are four total pieces to find. 
<br>
<br> remember to look high and low...
<br> they could be anywhere !! 
<br>
<br> GOOD LUCK!!
